The seed.sql file contains SQL INSERT statements that populate the database with sample data. It provides initial records for all core entities, including Users, Properties, Bookings, Payments, Reviews, and Messages. This seeded data simulates real-world usage (such as guests booking properties, hosts receiving payments, and users leaving reviews), which makes it easier to test queries, validate relationships, and ensure the database schema functions correctly.
